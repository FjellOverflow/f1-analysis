    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates how practice and qualifying lap times relate in Formula 1.\n",
    "Each race weekend features three free‑practice sessions (FP1, FP2, FP3) where drivers test setups and prepare for the qualifying session that determines the grid.\n",
    "Although practice laps are usually slower than qualifying laps, drivers often set quick “simulation” laps in practice that can foreshadow their qualifying performance and hint at the eventual pecking order.\n"

    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Qualifying**: we simply take the fastest qualifying lap for each driver.\n",
    "2. **Practice**: we collect every lap a driver completes across all practice sessions and keep the quickest one. The mean lap time would be less representative because drivers typically run at least one “qualifying‑simulation” lap, while the number of slower test laps varies widely.\n",
    "3. **IdealPractice**: for each driver, we sum the fastest sector times recorded during practice. This represents the best possible lap if the driver could combine all his fastest sectors in a single run.\n"
